### Why This Blog Exists

I’m starting this blog as a separate space to focus on something that’s been central to my career from the beginning: procurement and supply chain. 

I began my career on active duty as an artillery officer, where I learned, often the hard way, the value of logistics and disciplined supply chains. After leaving active duty, I joined the Army Reserves as a logistics officer, which deepened that lesson by putting me closer to planning, sustainment, and execution.

From there, I entered manufacturing as a Six Sigma Black Belt, working directly with procurement and supply chain teams to improve flow, cost, and operational outcomes.

I eventually moved into IT and data leadership not because technology was the destination, but because it was the most effective way to accomplish what I wanted to do in supply chain and procurement. Systems, analytics, and platforms became leverage.

IT was never the *thing*. It was the thing that got me to the *thing*.

This blog is for procurement and supply chain professionals looking for practical thinking grounded in real operations, not theory. If that resonates, you’re in the right place.

I'll still be writing about data teams, operations, and leadership at [my other blog.](https://peter.zaffina.net/blog/)
