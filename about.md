### Hi! I'm Peter Zaffina
I am a data and operations leader with a foundation in procurement, supply chain, and logistics. My career began on active duty as an artillery officer, followed by service in the Army Reserves as a logistics officer, where I developed a deep appreciation for the discipline and planning required to move resources efficiently. I then transitioned into manufacturing as a Six Sigma Black Belt, partnering with procurement and supply chain teams to drive measurable improvements in flow, cost, and operational outcomes.

Over time, I leveraged IT and data leadership not as a destination, but as a tool to enable better decision-making and more effective supply chains. Today, I focus on bridging technology and operations to help procurement and supply chain professionals solve complex challenges. This space shares insights drawn from real-world experience across military, manufacturing, and enterprise environments to provide practical guidance for those leading supply chain and procurement initiatives.
